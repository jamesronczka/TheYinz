TheYinz is a fun little project to create a web page that can display current or live tweets relevant to anyone...
living in or interested in the very unique and very charming Pittsburgh area ;)

CURRENT BUILD SETUP:
- have npm installed and install the following packages: Express, Twit

- load a web page in your browser with the following address: http://localhost:3000/

- use Node to run the script in whichever directory location you've placed the files

- reload the localhost:3000 web page

- most recent / relevant tweets should appear with relevant Pittsburgh hashtags among other conditions
